## Game Coach

This is a Game Coach app, allowing users to find board, card and video game coaches either for themselves or for groups of friends on games nights. This is a React implementation, using:
* Bootstrap 4
* Firebase (database, user authentication)
* React Router 4
* Redux
* React Day-Picker

It's still a work in progress, and work continues to enable all the functionality and connect it to the Firebase database. The app has some similarities to Board Game Sherpa, but this is a separate implementation.

## Challenges

Current challenges include effectively passing data values between components, and from child to parent components. I'm planning to incorporate a lot of functionality into the app, so it will become complex and it may be necessary to incorporate Redux for state management.
